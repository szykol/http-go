# http-go

Simple example http server written in Go.

It's not a full-fledged http server that strictly follows RFCs, rather this project aims to be a simple implementation that is easy to follow and understand.
This project is influenced by stdlib http implementation hence some of the interfaces might look familiar 

See [example app](example/main.go) to see how the library can be used.
